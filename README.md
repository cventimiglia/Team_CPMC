### About Our Project
The purpose of this project is to implement a functional API that takes
the name of an input file as its parameter and return the name of an
output file as its only result. The input file will specify the functionality
of software under test using the **category-partition method**. The API will
apply the **category-partition method** to the formatted contents of the input file,
generating test cases based on the specification, and writing the results for them
to an output file in the Cucumber "given-when-then" notation. The test cases will
specify the selection of equivalence classes for the parameter and the expected test
results when the test has been running.
### About the Category-Partition Method
As a tester, the number of tests that can be performed depends on a set of conditions
and parameters of a function. The number of tests can be small, but most of the time,
it is a large amount. Therefore, most testers use different testing techniques to help
limit the total number of tests needing to be completed. The **Category-Partition Method**
allows the tester to generate equivalence classes for each parameter. For example, an
integer parameter can have equivalence classes: “Negative”, “Positive”, “Max Integer Value”,
“Min Integer Value”, and “0”. These equivalence classes eliminate the need to test every number
of the same type. An example would be the numbers Seven or Eight. Since the two numbers are both
positive integers, they will provide the same functionality within the test.
